Bite-Buzz

User-friendly web app for food delivery using ReactJS for the front-end and NodeJS for the back-end. This combination ensures a smooth ordering process. Used MongoDB to store all the data securely and Stripe to handle online payments safely. To make the app accessible, deployed both the front-end and back-end using Render.
